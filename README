This app is being built using Ruby/Ruby on Rails/SQL DB/jQuery/YUI
initially to provide a Fixed Income Management Solution with Web UI and Web Services API,
specially keeping in mind customers who use the MyInterest Income Calculator iPhone App in iTunes App Store.
The Web Services API could be integrated to iPhone App MyInterest also. Hosted on Heroku for Staging it.
www.drinnovations.us was also designed by me using Rails/jQuery/YUI and it took a more Web Services API Viewpoint.
Comparing for UI: Server side Ruby processing and Web Services JSON Approaches.
Uses Active Record Queries in different styles.
May migrate to MongoDB also.


Overall, Under Design Investigation/Development.

Set up database.yml
rake db:migrate
script/server
